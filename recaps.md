# Story  
The team cleared out all the monsters from Thundertree without any thanks from [Reidoth]. However they did leave the dragon alone for the time being.  

To help with handling the Green Dragon they went to Neverwinter.  

While in Neverwinter Sylwynn explored the zoo's looking for animals to study. Not finding anything of interest in the zoo's, she went to the docks in hopes of finding any animal shipments from Chult. It turns out she was in luck, they had two dino's, a Deinonychus and an Allosaurus.  

Bang took this time to explore one of the zoo's as well. He managed to convice Jorge and Sylwynn to help him aquire a new pet. Skulking around until all the other patron's have left and staying out of sight of the guards. Under the cover of night he found the perfect prize. With the distraction that his teammates provided he aquired a new pet turtle.  

While in Neverwinter Sildar did mention he could find some people to hire for 25g each  

After their conversation with Sildar a group of mercenaries approached the team offering help. The deal that was worked out was they would take a cut of the dragon's hoard and they would discuss what to do with the dragons corpse after the fact.  

While the characters were talking with the mercenaries they learned there was an under ground arena nearby that they can place bets on themselves and fight for gold.

They fought in two matches, ending the night against two Trolls.


## recap
Sylwynn being trapped in the prison was careful to watch the behaviors of the guard until a good time showed itself.
Jorge, with Bang, waited for Sylwynn to show up at the Inn and when he felt she was over due he went to the place that was
mentioned in her letter from the night before to see what was going on.

While there he spoke to Raznor and got no help from him, or anyone else and was just lef to his own devices. 

Unknown to Sylwynn that Jorge was their to help her, she started her escape. She transformed into a spider and had absolute free regin. 
She quickly found her belongings and a number of other items. Even though she was a spider she was still careful about staying hidden. 
After about an hour she made it back up to the ground floor and just in time to see Jorge in a fight. While Jorge was taking out one of 
his aggressors another sneaked up behind him and knocked him out. It's unknown where Bang was at this time, but thankfully he was staying out of trouble.

Without being noticed, Sylwynn snuck into Jorge's armour perparing for when to lash out at their captors.

The captors where so over confident in their abilities they didn't notice that Sylwynn wasn't in her prison. 
Once they finally recongized she was missing they got on guard and one of the guards ran back up the stairs to notify others to prevent her escape.
It was at this time that Sylwynn transformed back to her normal shape while on a cultists face.

At the same time Jorge was coming too and with all the other distractions he was able to get to his feet and take out the nearest cultist.

During the fight Jorge took a leathel hit from magic missile, but thankfully Sylwynn was there and ready to give aid.

It took some time but they managed to get back to the ground floor, reunited with Bang and cleared out a good number of cultists.

Upon leaving the building they found some Lord's Alliance soldiers and notified them that the Damscus Consulate housed a coven of Dragon Cultists.
The soldiers didn't fully believe them so group was taken in for questioning. While at the Lord's Alliance headquater's they had a chance to 
speak with Sildar and tell him their story. After hearing the tale he gather a large task force to go investigate.

While Sildar was gone Jorge was looked after by some by healers and once recuperated he and Sylwynn sold some of their wares and identified what they
gained from the Dragon Cultists.

# Story from 9/7
Sildar talking to the group about the Dragon Cult activities in the Damascus Consulate

I was able to explore some of the building and did find the underground levels.
But it was already too late for finding out what was on the maps and the place was already busy as a beehive
with people covering up what happens there. The best I was able to do is to fine them for unauthrized
expansion in a building that is known to be close to the sewer systems.

There is very little else I can do, due to the connections that office has with Baldure's Gate. Political relationships
are always tenuous and those who I report to, don't want to shake the boat.

Take some solace to what you uncovered here. Since it is now known that this location was a haven for Cultist activity,
the cultists themselves now must find a new dwelling. This location will now be watched for the foreseeable
future.

Scouts have been dispatched to find the Druid Raznor to be brought in for questioning. He wasn't found in the Consulate
and no one there were willing to aid us in his wearabouts. 

You do need to be careful howevere, the kind of people that resided there don't take their loss of privacy lightly and 
either could be after you or have highered merc's to hunt you down. Watch your back.
