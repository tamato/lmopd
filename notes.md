## Acererak's 'beauty'
starts as a sepctre and can damage enemies for 1/20 the XP spent  
i.e. 200 xp == 10 damage

when it leaves the owners hand they feel alone  
-  mechanically this a -1 to atk/saving throws
-  splits, making rings to multiply  
-  the smaller bits are drawn to the larger one  
-  eventually starts to turn its owner against their friends
